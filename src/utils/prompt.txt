Lord of the mysteries: There are 7 Orthodox gods within this world: The eternal blazing sun, the lord of the storms, the earth mother, the evernight goddess, the god of steam and machinery, the god of wisdom and knowledge and the god of combat. Within this world, there are people known as beyonders who control supernatural powers. Their abilities are ranked based on Sequences, range from 0 to 9, with 22 pathways: Seer, Marauder, Apprentice, Spectator, Bard, Sailor, Reader, Secrets Suppliant, Sleepless, Corpse Collector, Warrior, Assassin, Hunter, Mystery Pryer, Savant, Monster, Planter, Apothecary, Criminal, Prisoner, Lawyer, and Arbiter. Each pathway corresponds to one of the major arcana cards. For instance, the Seer pathway corresponds to The Fool, with Spectator corresponding to Justice and so on. In order to become a beyonder one has to consume what's known as a "Beyonder Potion" that corresponds to one of the 22 pathways. You start of as a Sequence 9. Once consumed, you are unable to switch to a different pathway, unless you've become a sequence 5, in which case you may switch to one of the neighboring pathways. Seer, Marauder and Apprentice for instance are neighboring pathways, with Spectator, Bard, Sailor, Reader and Secrets Suppliant corresponding to another group. Sequence 5 and onwards, a ritual is required for the consumption of potions. Loss of control will occur if the ritual is incomplete. Once you become a Sequence 4, you become a demigod and  you obtain an incomplete mythical creature form. Sequence 3 has no changes with the exclusion of pathway specific features, however beyonders at that sequence are referred to as Saints. At Sequence 2, one completes their mythical creature form and are referred to as Angels. Sequence 1 beyonders can attempt to do a ritual where two other sequence 1 beyonder characteristics and the uniqueness corresponding  to the pathway is required in order to advance to Sequence 0, where one becomes a true deity and holds authority over their pathway and it's symbolism. A Great Old One, also known as Above The Sequence, is an existence who holds authority over all neighboring pathway's uniquenesses and their sefirot. For instance, the existence known as the Great Old One for Spectator, Bard, Sailor, Reader and Secrets Suppliant is known as "God Almighty", holding the respective authorities of Imagination, Light, Calamities, Omniscience and Degeneration. Angel families are families in which the ancestor was an angel. Such families include the Zaratul family and Antigonus of the Seer pathway, Abraham family of the Apprentice pathway, Zoroast and Amon family of the Marauder pathway, Medici family and Einhorn family of the Hunter pathway, Augustus family of the arbiter and lawyer pathways. Some churchs have their own organizations of beyonders. For instance, The Church of evernight has "Nighthawks", the church of steam and machinery has "Machinery hivemind", the church of the storms has "Mandated Punishers". Members of these organizations are known as Official Beyonders, and work with law enforcement. There are also secret organizations that arent managed by the churches. For instance, the demonness sect, aurora order and the secret order. There are 22 major arcana cards made by the former emperor of the Intis empire called "Blasphemy Cards", holding traits and abilities of the pathway they correspond to. These cards have anti-divination and anti-tracking properties, making them extremely valuable and powerful.

The world mainly has a northern and southern continent, vaguely ressembling northen and southern americas respectively. The northen continent is home to Backlund, the capital of the Loen kingdom, Trier, the capital of the Intis Republic, etc. The southern continent is home to East Balam, West Balam, and the Highlands Kingdom. There exists five seas: The beserk sea, the sonia sea, the fog sea, the polar sea, and the north sea. There also exists the eastern and western continents, however their existences are considered rumors.

The Main Character, Zhou Mingrui transmigrated into the body of Klein Moretti, a believer of the church of evernight. When he first woke up, he discovered that the original Klein Moretti had been studying a notebook that was now missing, before he had shot himself. The notebook is known as "The Antigonus Family's Notebook". The original Klein had studied history, and alongside two other friends they were studying the notebook. As Zhou Mingrui, now Klein, pondered, he discovered that the same two friends that he had been studying the notebook with had also shot themselves in the head, effectively killing them. After an investigation for the deaths of his friends, the local Nighthawks of tingen city had invited him to join them. After some contributions, Klein was eligible to become a sequence 9 beyonder. He had chosen the Seer pathway. He had assisted the Nighthawks and became close with his divinition teacher, Old Neil, the captain of the nighthawks, Dunn Smith, and one of the other members, Leonard Mitchell. There was a secret that Klein kept. When he first transmigrated, he tried replicating the steps he did before transmigrating. He took four steps counter-clockwise, saying an honorific in chinese. "The Immortal Lord of Heaven and Earth for Blessings; The Sky Lord of Heaven and Earth for Blessings; The Exalted Thearch of Heaven and Earth for Blessings; The Celestial Worthy of Heaven and Earth for Blessings." As the final words were uttered, he appeared in a place filled with a gray fog. Noting that it was empty, Klein tried to envision something — a palace with a table and seats within the gray fog. And it appeared. This fog is the sefirot of the seer, marauder and apprentice pathway, called "Sefirah Castle". He had unknowingly summoned two other people into the gray fog. When questioned who he was, Klein took advantage of this and put on a persona so that he could seem powerful while learning more information about the world. He used the name "Mr. Fool". One of the two people he had summoned, Audrey Hall, who came from a noble and wealthy family but wasnt a beyonder, suggested to make this into a gathering every week. The Fool, Klein, agreed, saying that there'd be a gathering every monday at 3pm loen backlund time. Audrey introduced herself as "Miss Justice" after noting that Mr Fool was the first of the tarot cards. As for the other person summoned, Alger Wilson who was a believer of the Lord Of Storms, and was a sequence 8 of the sailor pathway, took up the name "The Hanged Man". Eventually, Klein had contributed enough to the church of evernight and was able to advance to Sequence 8 of the Seer pathway, which was known as "Clown". However, an unfortunate disaster had happened a few weeks later. In it, Klein was pronounced dead alongside his captain and his divinition teacher. This was caused by an artifact by the name of 0-08, possessed by a man known as Ince Zangwill, a former archbishop of the church of evernight who had betrayed the church in search of power. 
Unknown to the others, Klein was actually still alive. It was also around this time, when the tarot gathering gained its newest member who came from a place inaccessible to all, known as The Forsaken Land Of The Gods. The new member, Derrick Berg, was actually quite young despite his height, and he went by the name "The Sun". He had faked his own death. Now, he's going to the capital of Loen, backlund, under the identity of an experienced detective, Sherlock Moriarty.
